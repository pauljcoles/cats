Change</em></a>,
Stephen Wendel presents five preconditions for humans to take action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<em>Cue</em>: the possibility of action needs to cross the person’s mind</li>
  <li>
<em>Reaction</em>: the person automatically and intuitively reacts to the idea in a
fraction of a second, generating an emotional response</li>
  <li>
<em>Evaluation</em>: the person thinks about the action consciously, evaluating the
costs and benefits</li>
  <li>
<em>Ability</em>: the person evaluates whether the action is feasible given the
current context</li>
  <li>
<em>Timing</em>: the person judges whether they should act now or later</li>
</ul>

<p>These five preconditions, along with <em>executing</em> the action, define the CREATE
funnel. According to Wendel, all five preconditions need to be met for
execution. As in most funnel models, people can drop off from the journey at
each stage.</p>

<p>For example, a writing tool might try to help bloggers write more regularly. It
could do this by sending custom email alerts to help people set up a routine
(cue). Some people will miss the alert completely because they don’t read email
frequently. The users who notice the alert will react emotionally within a
second. Some will ignore the email because they don’t feel like writing, and
some will spend a few moments thinking about the importance of their writing
routine (evaluation). Those who decide that the routine is important will click
the link to open a blank page in the writing tool, progressing through the
funnel. After a few seconds of staring at the blank page, some people will
realise that they don’t have the mental energy or inspiration to write
(ability), and some will start thinking about the topic of a new blog post. At
that point, some people will get distracted or decide to postpone writing
because of more urgent tasks (timing). Finally, those who decide that the timing
is right will start writing.</p>

<p>This model creates a useful structure for thinking about and creating stories.
Great user stories should be focused on causing behaviour changes, and once we
have nailed down a particular behaviour change, we can use the CREATE funnel to
come up with good story ideas. For example, we could change the cue from email
to a calendar alert, which is more likely to be seen. We could create a more
positive reaction by changing the visuals or the wording of the reminder.
Alternatively, we could provide historical information with the reminder to show
how important the routine is, and help with evaluation. We could offer amusing
or interesting writing ideas instead of the blank page to help users think more
positively about their ability to write. We could also prompt people 30 minutes
in advance to finish other tasks, helping to clear their minds for the writing
slot (timing).</p>

<p>Just as impact maps and story maps do, the CREATE funnel can help you create a
non-linear, hierarchical backlog. Good user stories typically aim to bring about
a behaviour change, so you should be able to link a story with a part of the
CREATE funnel for the relevant persona. This supports hierarchical planning and
prioritisation. Stakeholders can first choose the target persona for the current
milestone, then the behaviour they want to influence, and this pretty much helps
you nail down one funnel to work on. From there, you can prioritise stories that
contribute to that particular funnel.</p>

<p>The model is also useful for splitting stories. If a story is too big and it
tries to influence several parts of the funnel, we can split it into several
stories that address individual parts. Each small story will still make the
overall funnel more effective, so it will still be valuable.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-12">How to make it work</h3>

<p>Model the key actions for the target customer segment or persona, and break them
down using the different stages of the funnel. You will probably have one funnel
for each key action of each key persona. Because the funnel stages imply a
progression through time, it makes sense to order the segments horizontally from
left to right. Next to each segment, write down the critical features your
software provides currently, as the context for further work. Then group stories
vertically under each funnel segment, and prioritise by moving more important
stories towards the top, and less important stories towards the bottom. Another
option for prioritisation is to focus on a single segment first, and try to
improve in that area.</p>

<p>Think about establishing some kind of analytical system to measure the drop-off
through the funnel, if possible. This will give you a better framework for
prioritisation of segments, and a better benchmark for deciding when you can
move on to other work.</p>

<p>Once the funnel is visible on a whiteboard or a wall, most teams intuitively
create lots of good ideas for user stories that could help improve it. If you
get stuck, here are some ideas that Wendel suggests for influencing different
parts of the funnel in his book:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cue: change cues slightly to reduce the chance of users ignoring them; create
associations between user’s existing work tasks, routines or habits and the
product, avoid concurrent cues that seek actions.</li>
  <li>Reaction: build up trust, improve initial usage experiences.</li>
  <li>Evaluation: help users build habits that will make them skip the evaluation
and timing parts of the funnel. Support the user’s conscious decision to act,
by making tasks easier to accomplish or understand, automating repetition or
defaulting actions, remove friction.</li>
  <li>Ability: provide clear guides and action plans, provide small wins, reduce
risk of failure.</li>
  <li>Timing: use time-sensitive content, encourage early commitments, align with an
event that provides urgency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another interesting strategy is to try to invert the funnel, making inaction
work for the user’s benefit, by shifting the burden of work from the user to the
product. For example, after giving consent, the user has no more to do and
future actions are automated.</p>
