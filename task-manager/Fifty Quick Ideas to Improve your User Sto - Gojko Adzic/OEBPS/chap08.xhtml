<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0873897234/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0873897234&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=Y4CYWKJ5Y77SEP2O"><em>The Logical Thinking
Process</em></a>,
H. William Dettmer talks about three different areas of systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>zone of control</em> includes all those things in a system that we can change
on our own.</li>
  <li>The <em>sphere of influence</em> includes activities that we can impact, but can’t
exercise full control over.</li>
  <li>The <em>external environment</em> includes the elements over which we have no
influence.</li>
</ul>

<p>These three system areas, and the boundaries between them, provide a very useful
perspective on what a delivery team can hope to achieve with user stories.</p>

<p>A good guideline is that the user need of a story (‘In order to…’) should
ideally be in the sphere of influence of the delivery team, and the deliverable
(‘I want…’) should ideally be in their zone of control. This is not a 100%
rule and there are valid exceptions, but if a story does not fit into this
pattern it should be investigated.</p>

<p>When the user need of a story is in the zone of control of the delivery group,
the story is effectively a task without risk, which should raise alarm bells.
There are three common scenarios: The story might be fake, micro-story or
misleading.</p>

<p>Fake stories are those about the needs of delivery team members. For example,
‘As a QA, in order to test faster, I want the database server restarts to be
automated’.</p>

<p>Micro-stories are what you get when a large business story is broken down into
very small pieces, so that some small parts no longer carry any risk – they are
effectively stepping stones to something larger. Such stories are OK, but it’s
important to track the whole hierarchy and measure the success of the
micro-stories based on the success of the larger piece. If the combination of
all those smaller pieces still fails to achieve the business objective, it might
be worth taking the whole hierarchy out or revisiting the larger piece.</p>

<p>Misleading stories describe a solution and not the real user need. One case we
came across recently was ‘As a back-office operator, in order to run reports
faster, I want the customer reporting database queries to be optimised’. At
first glance, this seemed like a nice user story – it even included a
potentially measurable change in someone’s behaviour. However, the speed of
report execution is pretty much in the zone of control of the delivery team,
which prompted us to investigate further. We discovered that the operator asking
for the change was looking for discrepancies in customer information. He ran
several different reports just to compare them manually. Because of the volume
of data and the systems involved, he had to wait around for 20 to 30 minutes for
the reports, and then spend another 10 to 20 minutes loading the different files
into Excel and comparing them. We could probably have decreased the time needed
for the first part of that job significantly, but the operator would still have
had to spend time comparing information. Then we traced the request to something
outside our zone of control.  Running reports faster helped the operator to
compare customer information, which helped him to identify discrepancies (still
within our control potentially), and then to resolve them by calling the
customers and cleaning up their data. Cleaning up customer data was outside our
zone of control, we could just influence it by providing information quickly.
This was a nice place to start discussing the story and its deliverables. We
rephrased the story to ‘In order to resolve customer data discrepancies
faster…’ and implemented a web page that quickly compared different data
sources and almost instantly displayed only the differences. There was no need
to run the lengthy reports, the database software was more than capable of
zeroing in on the differences very quickly. The operator could then call the
customers and verify the information.</p>

<p>When the deliverable is outside the zone of control of the delivery team, there
are two common situations: the expectation is completely unrealistic, or the
story is not completely actionable by the delivery group.</p>

<p>The first case is easy to deal with – just politely reject it. The second case
is more interesting. Such stories might need the involvement of an external
specialist, or a different part of the organisation. For example, one of our
clients was a team in a large financial organisation where configuration changes
to message formats had to be executed by a specialist central team. This, of
course, took a lot of time and coordination. By doing the zone of control/sphere
of influence triage on stories, we quickly identified those that were at risk of
being delayed. The team started on them quickly, so that everything would be
ready for the specialists as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-key-benefits-6">Key benefits</h3>

<p>The concepts of the zone of control and sphere of influence are crucial for
systems thinking. By inspecting stories that fall outside the usual pattern, we
can identify root causes of problems and work on them, instead of just dealing
with the symptoms.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-6">How to make it work</h3>

<p>The system boundaries vary depending on viewpoint, so consider them from the
perspective of the delivery team.</p>

<p>If a story does not fit into the expected pattern, raise the alarm early and
consider re-writing it. Throw out or replace fake and misleading stories.
Micro-stories aren’t necessarily bad, but going so deep into detail is probably
an overkill for anything apart from short-term plans.  If you discover
micro-stories on medium-term or long-term plans, it’s probably better to replace
a whole group of related stories with one larger item.</p>

<p>If you discover stories that are only partially actionable by your team,
consider splitting them into a part that is actionable by the delivery group,
and a part that needs management intervention or coordination.</p>
