<p>Large-scale effects are a potential blind spot for any kind of frequent
iterative planning, including user stories. Many teams find themselves in a
tight spot by ignoring stakeholders who only function at the big-picture level,
such as people involved in corporate politics and external regulators. A good
way of preventing nasty big-picture surprises is to complement user personae
with some kind of large-scale stakeholder analysis.</p>

<p>User personae are now pretty much mainstream and many good books describe ways
of creating good personae and using them for driving user stories, so we won’t
repeat them here. But these books mostly focus on users who receive value, or
people directly involved with the day-to-day service that the software provides.
Teams rarely consider people who do not get value or participate in providing a
service using software, but have an interest in the initiative or a hidden
agenda that might interfere with the plan. Alistair Cockburn calls these
stakeholders <em>off-stage actors</em> in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201702258/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0201702258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=GYUFBW5H36OKUCND"><em>Writing Effective Use
Cases</em></a>.
This is a great name because it immediately conjures up the mental image of
someone behind the curtain.</p>

<p>We know of a project at a large UK gambling company, where two years of good
work were shelved indefinitely after a new stakeholder suddenly got involved
because of a political risk to his corporate fiefdom. To avoid problems such as
these, where a new stakeholder suddenly stops a team in its tracks, try creating
a stakeholder chart. The stakeholder chart is a simple stakeholder analysis
method, described by Dave Gray, Sunni Brown and James Macanufo in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XDUCLS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003XDUCLS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=D6LP36RTCCSVPBNY"><em>Gamestorming</em></a>.
It typically takes 30 minutes to an hour, and it should ideally involve the
entire team.</p>

<p>To create a chart, get the group to begin by listing as many stakeholders as
possible on post-it notes, especially thinking about any people or groups with
an off-stage interest. Gray and colleagues suggest starting with the following
questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who will be impacted by the project?</li>
  <li>Who will be responsible or accountable for the project?</li>
  <li>Who will have decision authority on the project?</li>
  <li>Who can support the project?</li>
  <li>Who can obstruct the project?</li>
  <li>Who has been involved in this type of project in the past?</li>
</ul>

<p>In the second step, create a 2x2 grid on the wall or a whiteboard, with axes
labelled interest and power, and group the post-its according to how important
your product or initiative is to a stakeholder (interest) and how much ability
they have to bring about their preference about a topic (power). This will
tighten your expectations and improve your awareness of how much you need to
work with different groups. For example, you might have strong supporters who
will work in your favour but don’t really wield a lot of organisational
influence, and there might also be groups who can stop you at will but don’t
particularly care about the work unless you mess up.</p>

<p>Each of these groups of stakeholders requires different involvement. The first
group might be willing to put up with half-finished stories, use manual
workarounds and provide frequent feedback. The second group is likely to want
finished and polished work, and will not provide many opportunities for feedback
and engagement.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-key-benefits-16">Key benefits</h3>

<p>A stakeholder chart helps you not to forget big-picture stakeholders who won’t
necessarily appear in user stories. It is particularly useful when the key to
achieving desired outcomes is changing the behaviour of other people, especially
in politically charged situations.</p>

<p>The chart creates a shared agreement in the delivery group about how to interact
with different types of stakeholders, so you can get the most out of each type.</p>

<p>It can also provide a useful input for story maps or impact maps, helping you to
remember additional important actors or personae.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-16">How to make it work</h3>

<p>The group of stakeholders is contextual and dependent on the outcome you are
trying to create, so make a stakeholder map only once you know the goals of a
milestone, and revisit it before starting another milestone. Teams who build a
component of an internal software platform normally work with the same group of
stakeholders most of the time. Teams who build consumer products often have to
significantly change their stakeholder maps between products or even milestones.</p>

<p>Although you can get the information about their scale of interest from the
stakeholders directly, the power scale will have to be assessed internally by
the team. In politically charged organisations, it would probably be best to
identify high-interest/high-power stakeholders first, and then invite them to a
workshop to complete the rest of the chart.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321834550/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321834550&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=O5YVU2PCFJAYZHOE"><em>Beyond
Requirements</em></a>,
Kent McDonald advises different strategies for each stakeholder group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low interest, low power: provide general information and monitor them, to make
sure their interest or power does not change during delivery, but do not bore
them.</li>
  <li>High interest, low power: keep informed and encourage detailed feedback.
Subject-matter experts often fall into this category. Although this group does
not have a lot of power, they might involve more influential groups if they
feel that their concerns are being ignored or their interests are in danger.</li>
  <li>Low interest, high power: engage infrequently to understand and satisfy
large-scale needs. Involve in milestone activities, such as creating or
reviewing business goals and impact maps.</li>
  <li>High interest, high power: work closely with these people, engaging them fully
and ideally making them part of the delivery group.</li>
</ul>
