<p>Discussing user stories instead of writing down all the details is a simple
idea, but organising an effective discussion is rarely easy. This is especially
problematic with larger teams. Without strong facilitation and time management,
a discussion of stories can turn into yet another boring meeting.</p>

<p>Groups of 4 to 5 stimulate participation and discussion, but anything larger
often encourages one person to hold a sermon and everyone else to check email on
their phones. Larger groups often also use projectors and presentations, falling
into all the problems explained in the section on using low-tech for story
conversations.</p>

<p>Our preferred way of facilitating story discussions for teams of 10 to 20 people
is to split the team into several smaller groups, get groups to capture their
understanding of a story using examples, then bring the groups together to
compare results. Splitting allows different groups to explore their
understanding and collect questions faster than with a large team. Groups use
concrete examples to show their understanding, so it’s easy to compare different
outcomes. Bringing groups together helps to coordinate and identify sources of
misunderstanding. After several cycles of splitting and bringing groups
together, all team members have a pretty good idea about the contents and the
scope of a story. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321636406/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321636406&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=FBZRRAAAGETVD2U5"><em>Practices For Scaling Lean and
Agile</em></a>,
Craig Larman and Bas Vodde call these cycles <em>diverge and merge</em>.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-key-benefits-21">Key benefits</h3>

<p>Diverging and merging helps to engage a large group, and to increase the
participation of individual team members. With ten people in a meeting, one
person can easily tune out. That’s much easier to prevent with a smaller group.
In a smaller group each person has to compare their understanding with the rest
of the team, so it becomes easier to spot sources of confusion.</p>

<p>Breaking into several groups also prevents a fake consensus. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0349116059/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0349116059&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=5OZQMGOJNPHSBFFC"><em>The Wisdom Of
Crowds</em></a>
James Surowiecki shows how people with a similar background tend to work towards
a consensus, even if the direction is not correct. By diverging and merging we
can minimise this effect. Each subgroup works towards a consensus, but different
groups can still go in different directions.</p>

<p>The merging part makes it easy to identify potential sources of misunderstanding
and differences in opinions by comparing the examples from different groups.</p>

<p>The diverge and merge cycle is also a great example of set-based design, a lean
problem-solving technique where several solutions are built in parallel and then
combined. Set-based design is more costly but much faster than having just one
group work on a problem. Applied to story conversations, this means that the
team learns and discovers the right solution faster when diverging and merging
than as a single large group. With short iterative delivery cycles, time is
often the critical constraint, so faster is better even if more expensive.
Individual subgroups tend to explore the story from different perspectives,
discovering different questions, knowledge gaps and inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Finally, diverge and merge cycles help to avoid reliance on a single source of
all knowledge. It’s easy for one person to dominate the discussion with a single
large group. This puts a huge responsibility on that individual to be correct
all the time and know everything. When the group breaks out for independent
discussions, the domination problem does not exist. Everyone has to participate
and the team quickly identifies alternative solutions and opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-21">How to make it work</h3>

<p>Get groups to use concrete examples to capture their understanding and write
those examples down on a whiteboard or a flipchart. This is imperative because
it provides the ammunition for merging discussions. Concrete examples are easy
to compare, which means it is easy to identify sources of misunderstanding among
different groups. We ask groups to start writing down three to four very simple
examples as soon as possible. This helps to set the structure for further
examples, but also gets people to write quickly. People often get stuck trying
to come up with complex boundary conditions, but they will come naturally once
the first few really simple examples are on the board.</p>

<p>To get the best results, communicate that the purpose of the diverge part is not
to find all the answers, but to find good questions quickly. Time-box diverge
cycles to about 10 to 15 minutes and bring the team together to discuss the
results. In particular, focus on the differences among the groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>differences in the format or structure of information</li>
  <li>differences in outcomes of similar examples</li>
  <li>things scratched out and question marks</li>
</ul>

<p>Structural or formatting differences are important because they reflect mental
models. If one group considers some attributes important and another group does
not, we need to align. Perhaps the first group is going too far, perhaps the
second group is not considering important edge cases.</p>

<p>Differences in outcomes of similar examples clearly show potential
misunderstandings, so they need to be discussed and ironed out.</p>

<p>Corrections, things scratched out on whiteboards and question marks are a sign
that a group had an important discussion and identified things that might not be
clear to others as well. These should be discussed with the whole team.</p>

<p>It’s often useful to choose a facilitator to keep track of time and lead the
discussion during merging. The facilitator is also responsible for comparing the
results of different groups. For teams where one person is clearly much more
experienced and involved in the business domain than others, that person is
probably the best choice for the facilitator. Having the most experienced person
stand back and observe allows the whole group to benefit from that person’s
knowledge. At the same time, the most experienced person can easily spot
misunderstandings and prevent groups from going too far in the wrong direction.</p>
