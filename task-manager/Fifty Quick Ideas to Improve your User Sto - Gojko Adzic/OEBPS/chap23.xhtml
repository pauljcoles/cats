<p>Good user stories are a reminder to have a conversation. They are there to
facilitate a discussion, not a presentation, not a monologue, and definitely not
a session where ten people stare at a projector screen while one person
struggles to type.</p>

<p>Communication technology has advanced in giant leaps over the last few decades,
but we have yet to see a gizmo that facilitates a discussion as well as a
flipchart or a whiteboard. Many teams destroy a conversation by tooling up too
soon. They try to record story discussions in Excel or a testing tool
immediately, often with a projector. This creates a keyboard bottleneck – only
one person can act as a scribe and most of the others relax in their chairs and
secretly play Angry Birds on their mobile phones.</p>

<p>Projectors or screen-sharing might be necessary for distributed teams, but if
all your team members are located in one place please resist the urge to use
hi-tech for your story discussions. Whiteboards will do a much better job.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-key-benefits-19">Key benefits</h3>

<p>Not using digital media during a conversation allows teams to focus on the topic
at hand, rather than text alignment issues, bold formatting or guessing the
right syntax. It’s important to record the results of a conversation, but that
can be postponed. With fewer distractions, discussions around whiteboards are
faster and more productive than discussions around a technical tool.</p>

<p>Another benefit of using a whiteboard is that people can capture their ideas in
any way they see fit. Tools typically take away that flexibility, and constrain
the discussion to one particular format. If Excel is on the projector, you’re
pretty much guaranteed to end up with a table even if a list of bullet points
would do a better job. A whiteboard allows people to draw pictures, connect
boxes with arrows, write sentences, order things into tables or lists, scratch
things out and start over easily.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-19">How to make it work</h3>

<p>Projectors, spreadsheets and other high-tech gizmos can play useful roles in
exploring what a software system does at the moment, or looking at the
competition, but shut them down once the real conversation starts. Make people
stand up and write. This will lead to a much faster and much more productive
discussion.</p>

<p>Use physical index cards and sticky notes instead of collecting information on
virtual card walls. Digital card walls are great for tracking and sharing, but
horrible for conversations. Physical cards are much easier to create, move,
throw away and annotate. Because of that, it is much faster to change priorities
on a physical board than inside a digital tool. Digitise the results only after
you are happy with the conversation outcome.</p>

<p>If at all possible, avoid meeting rooms with big boardroom tables. They invite
people to sit down and negotiate, instead of standing up and discussing. Big
tables that block most of the room space prevent people from moving around, so
they limit physical interaction. Rooms without tables but with lots of wall
space for whiteboards are best for this kind of conversation. Rooms without
tables also make it awkward and difficult to use laptops, so people will be more
engaged in conversations. With tables, open laptops often distract participants
with instant messaging and email.</p>

<p>Digital whiteboards are not yet as effective as a physical ones. The technology
might change in the future, but at the moment all digital boards introduce a
significant time lag while writing and require people to hold the pen at exactly
the right angle, which is just distracting. If you do not have enough
whiteboards, get some whiteboard film (some shops sell this as whiteboard
material or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MQPL3S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005MQPL3S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=PBAXWKWVJEL66NYK"><em>Magic
Whiteboard</em></a>).
The film sticks to a wall with static electricity so you can put it up and take
it down easily. Whiteboard film will give you a larger working surface than a
flipchart, and has the added benefit that you can easily take the results with
you, unlike a typical whiteboard that stays in the meeting room.</p>

<p>If you absolutely have to discuss stories remotely, aim for visual and
communication aids instead of tools which constrain you to a particular way of
writing things down. Many teams we worked with had reasonable success using
video teleconferencing equipment to record and show the contents of flip charts
or whiteboards to remote team members. For situations where team members can
form small groups in different locations, getting each group to work around a
whiteboard and then taking a photo of the result to share with the entire team
during a joint remote video discussion might be quite effective. If most of the
team is in one location, a high-resolution video camera pointed at the flip
chart to stream the discussion to one or two remote team members works well
also.</p>

<p>If that’s not an option for you, collaborative document editing is probably the
best option. In that case, try to use a tool which allows all participants to
type concurrently, instead of having the conversation blocked by one scribe.
The best tools are the ones which don’t constrain you too much, so people can
experiment with different ways of writing things down. Google Docs are an OK
option in this case. For discussions involving only two or three people, remote
screen-sharing might work well also.</p>
