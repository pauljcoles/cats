<p>Most good stories are multi-layered. They influence one thing which leads to
another which improves some high-level aspect of someone’s work. Such stories
are very difficult to capture with just a single value statement, and forcing
them into any kind of standard story format actually prevents fruitful
discussion.</p>

<p>For example, think about an online text editor that enables users to share
documents with their colleagues. The first version supports viewing shared
documents using the most popular desktop browsers, and the business users are
now proposing to extend sharing support to less popular browsers, mobile
devices, and older versions of desktop browsers. This change would have
immediate direct value to recipients of shared documents, because they would be
able to view content on the go, as well as in older and more obscure browser
versions. It would provide value indirectly to users who send shared documents,
because they would be more confident that the recipients would view the content
correctly. This would in turn provide value to the text editor website
operators, through deeper user engagement. Better engagement leads to increased
revenue from selling premium features. Better sharing compatibility also
improves built-in viral marketing, because people who receive shared documents
might sign up and become users, at first using free features and paying for
premium features later. This story has at least four levels of value. Selecting
any single level and focusing only on it doesn’t really paint the right picture.</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘In order to <em>increase revenue</em>, as a <em>site operator</em>, I want better browser
compatibility for shared documents’ sounds too high level and disconnected
from reality, in particular because users do not pay for sharing or viewing.</li>
  <li>‘In order to <em>increase viral sign-ups</em>, as a <em>site operator</em>, I want better
browser compatibility for shared documents’ sounds more down to earth but
doesn’t really capture the core reason behind the change.</li>
  <li>‘In order to <em>increase user engagement</em>, as a <em>site operator</em>, I want better
browser compatibility for shared documents’ describes the core reason behind
the change, but it’s not clear why the deliverable would lead to the value.</li>
  <li>‘In order to <em>view documents in mobile browsers more easily</em>, as an <em>anonymous
recipient of a shared document</em>, I want better sharing compatibility’ sounds
as if the user group is completely irrelevant for the bigger picture.</li>
  <li>‘In order for recipients to <em>view documents easier</em>, as a <em>document creator</em>,
I want better browser compatibility for shared documents’ sounds as if it’s a
nice feature to have but not contributing to the bottom line.</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases like this, we’ve seen people spend half an hour arguing which of the
values and users to put into their prescribed story format, only for the
business users to get up and leave, insisting that that they don’t care about
what’s in the story, but it has to be done, and done yesterday. At that point,
the story turns into an all-or-nothing task, and it becomes incredibly difficult
to slice it, negotiate scope, or prioritise iterative deliveries.</p>

<p>To get the most out of stories, think about several levels of value, and try to
identify through discussion whether there is a story within a story. If you end
up arguing about which value statement to choose, just list several of them and
capture the whole chain of reasoning. Then invest the time you saved into the
actual discussion about the story, instead of wasting it on wording.</p>

<p>Adrian Howard had a great example of this: a story that allowed users to sign up
through social networks. The original story proposal was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an unregistered user I would like to sign up using Twitter so that I don’t
have to re-enter all of my info and remember a new password.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Investigating further levels of value, they discovered that this could bring the
following benefits to the organisation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decreased drop-out during registration</li>
  <li>having access to people’s social network accounts for marketing purposes</li>
  <li>opening a path for further social network integration features</li>
</ul>

<p>In the original story description, potential business value was masked in trying
to meet a perceived user need, and the story did not explain the big picture
directly. Discussing the three higher-level options further, they decided to
focus on decreased drop-out. This lead to a hypothesis that giving users the
option to register through Twitter would improve the conversion rates by 5%.
This led to a quick test – a link to register via Twitter which just measured
clicks and displayed a message that the feature would be available soon. After
disappointing click results, they decided to drop the story and build something
else instead.</p>

<p>When the whole chain of reasoning is clear, it’s much easier to have a useful
discussion on what the story really needs to deliver and to design experiments
to validate the underlying assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-27">How to make it work</h3>

<p>For a start, think about the two most typical levels: the value to the user and
the value to the organisation selling or operating the software. If you can find
a story that brings both, then you have a win-win situation. Thinking about
these two levels often opens up a good discussion about user needs or a whole
chain of events in between keeping users happy and increasing or protecting
revenue. Then try to focus on the higher-level values first, and prove that they
actually make sense.</p>
