<p>One of the biggest advantages of user stories is getting delivery teams to think
from the perspectives of users. Instead of purely focusing on how to build
something, delivery teams consider how their products will be used. This is
central to the user story technique – hence the name. Yet the vast majority of
stories we’ve seen in the wild refer to a completely generic customer segment,
very often starting literally with ‘As a user…’</p>

<p>In a horrible case of mistaken identity, a placeholder on a template became an
acceptable value, and teams started using a mythical generic user to justify
scope creep. A generic user role can never provide a useful context for
discussion. Without considering a particular user segment, it’s impossible to
decide whether the proposed solution is the right one, or if it’s just
unnecessary scope creep. Unless we think about a narrow target group, it’s
impossible to effectively plan releases and measure impacts or even discuss
completeness.</p>

<p>Using generic roles is often a get-out-of-jail-free card for people who want to
push in pet features, or unjustified scope. For example, a team we recently
worked with had a story ‘As a user I want to log in through social networks in
order not to remember another username and password’. The story checklist
originally involved Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ and OpenID, and all
those would become individual stories later on. Because it was not clear who was
the mythical user, the stakeholders clearly thought that the more networks the
team could integrate the better. Someone even found a third-party service that
would allow twenty or so social networks to be integrated instantly. The service
would be cheap at first, but bring significant cost at scale. It was difficult
to judge whether using the third party service was a better choice than
integrating with individual networks, until the team challenged the generic
role. The two major groups that would really benefit from this story were both
from the educational world: teachers and students in schools. This pushed the
discussion towards integrating only with Google accounts. Google accounts
include Google Apps for Education, very popular in educational institutions, and
would allow anyone with a Google Mail account to sign in as well. LinkedIn is a
network for professionals and it wasn’t particularly popular with the newly
understood target audience. Although Facebook and Twitter are popular with the
new target group, many schools actually block those sites from school networks,
so integrating those would probably be a waste of time. By challenging a generic
user role and considering a concrete customer segment, the team was able to
significantly reduce unnecessary scope and make important product management
decisions more easily (no need to buy a third party service).</p>

<p>Avoid ‘as a user’ statements like the plague. Avoid overly generic customer
segment descriptions of any kind. Don’t just aim to fill in a placeholder in a
story template, identify and describe user segments that will help you
facilitate productive discussion of needs and solutions.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-key-benefits-5">Key benefits</h3>

<p>Focusing stories on a particular customer segment helps to kick-start useful
conversations about user stories. Clear and accurate descriptions of user roles
help to identify needs and remove unnecessary complexity. Once you understand
who will use the product you’re building, it becomes possible to compare
different solution options, offer alternatives or even discard features that
won’t fit.</p>

<p>In addition, well-defined user roles are crucial when you want to implement good
product management and planning strategies, for example splitting stories by
narrowing down segments, or prioritising impacts on customer groups.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-5">How to make it work</h3>

<p>For internal IT or enterprise projects, try to identify the actual people who
will be using the target system, and investigate how work is divided. Different
departments or areas of focus will help you identify useful user segments.</p>

<p>For consumer systems, good starting points are user personae, described in many
good books including Alan Cooper’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OZ0N62/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000OZ0N62&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=7GGVJK7OYOABY6TG"><em>Inmates are Running the
Asylum</em></a>.
Another nice reference is the persona checklist presented by Stephen Wendel in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GGYNBEQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00GGYNBEQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=5G3A3R7DLMIM2BVY"><em>Designing for Behavior
Change</em></a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prior experience with action</li>
  <li>Prior experience with similar products and channels</li>
  <li>Relationship with company or organisation</li>
  <li>Existing motivation</li>
  <li>Physical, psychological or economic impediments to action</li>
</ul>

<p>This checklist is great because it enables teams to identify quickly different
groups of users based on five important aspects. Note that the term ‘action’ in
Wendel’s system refers to the activity that is assisted or managed by the
software product, which maps to the benefit of a story (‘in order to…’).</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to group users by common behaviours. Market research
is often a good start for defining customer groups, because they structure
surveys by needs and behaviours. A great example of this is the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/CellfishInc/bandsintown-reveals-what-makes-live-music-fans-tick-14065294"><em>Anatomy of a
Live Music
Fan</em></a>
survey published by BandsInTown. </p>
