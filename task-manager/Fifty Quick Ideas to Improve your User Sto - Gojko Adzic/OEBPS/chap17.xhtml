<p>Teams working on new product development often struggle to align stakeholder
priorities, jumping between stories aimed to improve short-term revenue,
preparing for long-term sustainability (or sometimes world domination) and
marketing initiatives that immediately bring new users. All those needs are
valid so it’s difficult to balance them, especially with a small team and
limited delivery capacity. On the one hand, disregarding long-term needs is
irresponsible and may prevent sustainable scalability just when the product
starts taking off. On the other hand, disregarding short-term needs may cause
the product to never take off at all. The problem is actually even worse,
because there are different types of short-term needs – user base growth,
revenue growth, and the activities performed by a single user or a group of
users together.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449335675/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1449335675&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=4RS56XNAEOB7KENZ"><em>Lean
Analytics</em></a>,
Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz suggest a common growth model for
successful products:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<em>Empathy</em>: figuring out how to solve a real problem in a way that people will
pay for</li>
  <li>
<em>Stickiness</em>: building the right product to keep users around</li>
  <li>
<em>Virality</em>: growing the user base organically and artificially</li>
  <li>
<em>Revenue</em>: establishing a sustainable, scalable business model with the right
margins in a healthy ecosystem</li>
  <li>
<em>Scale</em>: growing the business</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously the names of the stages are most applicable to consumer software, but
similar stages apply to business-to-business software as well. Internal
enterprise development doesn’t fit well into these stages, because growth and
revenue are probably predetermined. However, even with enterprise software it’s
still worth making sure that the right problem is being solved before preparing
for large-scale deployment.</p>

<p>The lean analytics sequence of stages provides an important framework for
prioritising user stories. For example, it would be wasteful to focus on
virality until customer retention and usage frequency (aspects of stickiness)
are good enough. Even if virality improves, lots of users would come but
wouldn’t stay for long, and they wouldn’t come back often enough. It’s far
better to improve retention and usage frequency first, so that viral expansion
has a big impact.</p>

<p>The stages of growth constitute an interesting model for thinking because they
can help with alignment and focus. Getting stakeholders to agree on the current
stage of growth helps with now/not now prioritisation. Expanding on the idea
that great user stories describes behaviour changes, there are only a few
important behaviour changes at each stage. For example, most stories in the
stickiness stage should be about using the product more frequently, coming back
more, using the product for longer periods of time.</p>

<p>The stages of growth are also great as an input for many other product
management techniques, such as building a value model and choosing the central
goal of an impact map. All these things depend on the context of the current
stage.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-14">How to make it work</h3>

<p>At each stage, the delivery team should focus on addressing a particular set of
risks, by tracking the right measurements and setting concrete objectives. User
stories need to follow that focus.</p>

<p>The most important thing to do when using the model is to get all the
stakeholders to agree on the stage the product is in currently. When you’re just
starting out this will be clear, but aligning everyone on the current position
might be quite a challenge for work already in progress. In general, trust more
the people who argue for the earlier part of the funnel than for the later part.
A good way to facilitate alignment is to get data on current performance for
each of the stages and ask key decision-makers if they are satisfied. Choose the
first stage that people aren’t happy about.</p>

<p>The next step is to choose the objectives for the current stage and identify
some quantifiable target metrics which will tell the group that the product is
exiting one stage and entering another. For example, define your target user
churn, usage frequency and session length for the stickiness stage, and focus on
user stories that could create impacts in these areas. Once you have your
targets, move on to the next stage and define targets for user base growth. The
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449335675/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1449335675&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=4RS56XNAEOB7KENZ"><em>Lean
Analytics</em></a>
book has many case studies with metrics from successful companies. You can use
these case studies to compare your situation with the market and design
checkpoints and target measurements for stages.</p>

<p>Croll and Yoskovitz even suggest choosing <em>One Metric that Matters</em> (OMM) at
each stage, a representative measurement of progress that will align the entire
company and provide a laser-tight focus for product management. The topic of
choosing the right metric is far beyond the scope of this short introduction,
but the their book has a whole section devoted to it.</p>

<p>The stages of growth model, although temporal, is not supposed to create
multiple backlogs. Don’t plan too far in advance, and don’t collect too many
stories for future stages. On the other hand, this model is also not supposed to
create hermetically sealed boundaries between stages. It’s still OK to make
money (and plan stories for doing this) in the stickiness stage, for example.
Likewise, it’s also OK to prepare for scaling in early stages, or improve
virality once you start focusing on revenue. However, the main focus should be
on the critical objectives for the current stage. If the majority of your
stories are about scaling and the product is in the virality stage, you’re
prioritising the wrong things.</p>
