<p>Planning with user stories, if done well, puts business stakeholders well and
truly in the driving seat for decisions on software delivery. It enables teams
to deliver value frequently, react to market opportunities and outrun the
competition. Most of the tips in this book are about delivering value sooner.
But in this section, we’d like to warn against a potential pitfall with focusing
too much on this.</p>

<p>A few years ago Gojko audited a legacy migration initiative, where the delivery
team, wanting to be helpful, encouraged the business stakeholders to replan and
reprioritise frequently. The decision-makers constantly chose small wins and
low-hanging fruit. After a year and a half of work, data migration had never
come to the top of the list of priorities, largely because it was a big, messy,
risky problem. With the budget almost spent and small wins not really providing
the return on investment expected from the legacy migration, the project was
canned.</p>

<p>Perhaps an even better example of delivering small increments while losing the
big picture is the FBI Sentinel project, which cost 451 million USD and almost
failed. In <a href="http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2012/06/mco2012060073-abs.html"><em>Why the FBI Can’t Build a Case Management
System</em></a>,
Jerome Israel highlights one of the biggest risks of iterative delivery. After
the first phase of the Sentinel project, the FBI wanted more visibility so they
required the contractor to start delivering software frequently. As a safeguard,
they created a strong programme management department. During Phase 2, the
programme managers had bi-monthly meetings with senior FBI stakeholders, showing
status charts. They even had a project thermometer, which captured the overall
status in red, yellow or green. For two years, the thermometer always showed
yellow trending towards green. In October 2009, the contractor missed its
deadline for delivery of Phase 2, and all the critical problems ‘came crashing
down on the project’. An independent audit of the project concluded that there
were more than ‘10,000 inefficiencies’. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321896904/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321896904&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkId=NJ65KJI5LOS375CD"><em>The Lean
Mindset</em></a>,
Tom and Mary Poppendieck comment on that study, saying that due to the pressure
to demonstrate progress, development turned towards easy tasks and always
postponed serious risks. The project management approach focused on tracking
activity, and not on addressing risks. Although the Sentinel project did not
employ user stories in the first two phases, this example is quite illustrative
of the situation we see often with teams working on stories. (The Phase 2
failure caused them to adopt agile methods eventually and the story has a happy
ending.)</p>

<p>Both examples illustrate how having to make frequent deliveries makes teams
focus on short-term wins and neglect long-term risks, until the work becomes
completely unsustainable. This is caused not only by the pressure to deliver but
also by doing progress reports mostly by tracking activity. Prioritisation is a
big problem with user stories, especially if business stakeholders do not have
experience with iterative planning. Small, easy wins always get prioritised over
difficult tasks. It’s like children choosing between chocolate and broccoli.
User stories are split to avoid risky areas, and at some point the celling comes
crashing down. </p>

<p>To avoid falling into this trap, delivery teams should work with stakeholders to
set explicit deadlines for addressing major risks at a sustainable pace.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-key-benefits-8">Key benefits</h3>

<p>Having an explicit plan to deal with big risks allows stakeholders and the
delivery team to strike the right balance between short-term business wins and
long-term sustainability.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to plan deadlines that deal with risks as decision points for
incremental investment. This helps to prevent difficult and risky work from
being constantly postponed and replaced with small short-term wins.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-8">How to make it work</h3>

<p>At the Scandinavian Developer Conference in 2011, <a href="http://gojko.net/2011/04/04/is-prioritisation-based-on-business-value-right/">Alistair Cockburn
suggested</a>
periodically shifting gears during delivery and alternating between ‘paying to
learn’ (addressing major risks) and ‘paying to get business value’. Cockburn
advised that in earlier stages, the focus should be more on addressing risks
than on building value. His summary was ‘Develop for business value – once the
risks are down’.</p>

<p>For new product development, you can use the Lean Analytics stages of growth
model to decide which risks to address and when to switch between delivering
value and addressing risks as the product moves through the different stages.
For internal IT initiatives, identify major risks and decide when such areas
need to be clarified so that stakeholders can make sustainable planning
decisions.</p>

<p>One potential strategy is to plan for addressing risks with learning stories,
and put a ‘best before’ date on them. It is also a good idea to agree upfront
what kind of deliverables need to be in place to show that the risks have been
addressed: full implementation of the relevant piece of software, a working
prototype, or just a conceptual design.</p>

<p>Creating a hierarchical backlog can also stop the team and stakeholders from
turning delivery into a stream of consciousness and never dealing with big
risks. Once a hierarchy is in place, stakeholders can prioritise at a level
higher than stories, for example by picking impacts. Putting deadlines on items
that address risks can help to balance out risk mitigation and delivery of
value, as delivering stories with major impacts is likely to require both.</p>

<p>As an aside, please don’t use activity metrics such as velocity or burn-down
scope to measure progress. They only show that people have been busy, not that
they were working on the right things or even producing something valuable.
Activity metrics are great to measure whether the team is working well together
or not, but they can’t show real progress. Measuring progress with activity
creates a completely wrong set of incentives for prioritisation. Instead, create
a model for expected business value delivery and report progress towards it.</p>
