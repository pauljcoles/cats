<p>The user story map, invented by Jeff Patton, is a popular way of organising
hierarchical backlogs. The idea came from the customer journey maps used in
interaction design. User story maps connect software deliverables to customer
journeys and business workflows, showing how individual stories contribute to
the bigger picture and providing a great visual representation of release plans.</p>

<p>A story map is a grid where the horizontal axis represents steps in a high-level
user activity, and the vertical axis represents the software delivery schedule
(releases or milestones). User stories are grouped in the grid based on the
activity or workflow step they contribute to. Stories are spread vertically
based on delivery priority, optionally identifying the release they are planned
for.</p>

<p>Story maps are a great visualisation tool because they help delivery teams
engage business stakeholders in productive discussions about needs, potential
solutions and delivery planning all at the same time. A simple tabular structure
is easy to understand and feels natural to business stakeholders. Vertical
positioning allows teams to play with different release proposals and explore
options before committing to a solution.</p>

<p>User stories are great because they help delivery teams consider the perspective
of the users of their software. Story maps take this even further, by putting
stories into the perspective of a wider user journey. They help teams get a
better insight into why they are building software and how it fits into the big
picture.</p>

<p>Apart from a few rare exceptions, any software product is just a part of a wider
business activity or customer experience that often starts and ends outside
interacting with software. Software might just speed up a certain part of some
activity or provide a new way of doing something. Mapping out a user journey
helps teams to consider user stories in a wider context, spot missing or
unnecessary steps, and create new product ideas.</p>

<p>Organising stories in a tabular way also helps to avoid linear thinking,
supporting hierarchical backlogs. Because of this, story maps help with
prioritisation, story splitting and providing focus for release planning. In
particular, by mapping out a journey and then considering stories within the
context of different actions, story maps help teams think about user stories as
options instead of commitments.</p>

<p>Many teams struggle to fit interaction design into iterative delivery. Story
maps provide a good framework for considering user interaction journeys and
mapping out iterative releases and milestones in that context. It’s then much
easier to plan work on interaction design, prioritising parts of the journey
that are relevant for the upcoming milestone.</p>

<p>By grouping related stories together, stakeholders often see that they can
enable certain actions with a simpler choice of deliverables, and postpone more
complex stories for later releases. For internal IT initiatives, story maps
often open a discussion on skipping some steps or offering a semi-automated
solution to get to the initial release sooner.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-11">How to make it work</h3>

<p>Create story maps for key user activities – not for software solutions. For
example, purchasing a book, booking a venue or attending a concert are good
activities to map out. Submitting a rating or posting to a social network site
are too low level – they are parts of some higher-level activity and do not
deserve their own maps.</p>

<p>As the first step, identify the backbone of the story map – the horizontal
axis. Break down activities into high-level steps. The steps should not imply a
particular technology or a solution. For example, discovering an interesting
book is a step in a purchasing activity that does not imply a solution. Getting
book recommendations from a social network is not a key step – instead, it’s
just one way to discover interesting books. So discovering books would be a good
candidate for the key step on the backbone, and social recommendations would be
a good candidate story for that vertical. Identifying steps that do not imply
solutions will allow you to come up with good ideas later.</p>

<p>Once the backbone is in place, try to identify options for stories. Then move
items vertically to plan releases. Think about skipping a particular workflow
step altogether or providing a partial solution. For example, think about
reducing repetitive work to a single action or providing a manually assisted
initial version. This will help identify smaller release candidates that can be
shipped sooner.</p>

<p>Create story maps on a large whiteboard or a wall using physical cards or sticky
notes, so that you can move them easily. Putting maps into a software tool too
early kills conversations. Physical cards allow stakeholders to play with
vertical positioning and prioritisation easily and discuss potential iterative
releases.</p>

<p>If a user segment has two or three potential journeys involving your system,
it’s often good to create a combined story map where those journeys are ordered
from left to right on the backbone. This will give you a big picture overview
and help with high-level prioritisation for milestones. For more complex
situations, describing individual journeys with separate maps is better.</p>

<p>If your product has many user segments with potential journeys, consider setting
the vision and high-level priorities using an impact map. Each impact is likely
to be a change in one user journey, so you can then create a story map for the
top priority impact.</p>
