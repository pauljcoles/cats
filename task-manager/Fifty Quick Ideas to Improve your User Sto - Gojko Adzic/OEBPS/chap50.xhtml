<p>Story prioritisation is a classical trap for inexperienced product owners. Those
who try to make all priority decisions themselves discover quickly that
prioritisation takes too long and nobody is happy at the end. Those who try to
delegate priority decisions to business stakeholders find themselves in a
cross-fire of people aiming for different business objectives. The problem is
often that prioritisation is done at the wrong level.</p>

<p>User stories should be relatively small and provide some value, but a single
story rarely delivers everything needed to complete a business objective.
Because of this, plans typically include lots of small stories. Such small
stories are generally difficult to compare. Unless there is a fire to put out,
it will not be easy to choose between a story that saves a bit of call centre
time with a new report and a story that reduces fraud by a fraction through
tighter payment controls. It’s also difficult to decide whether all six stories
about fraud reduction need to be done, or if doing just three and moving on to
something else after would be better.</p>

<p>As an alternative to story prioritisation, try to pick the most important
impacts on customers. Impacts are much easier to discuss and compare than
stories, as explained in the section Describe a behaviour change. Combine this
with the idea of budgeting instead of estimating and you can get a set of nice
constraints for the delivery team. The product owner and the delivery team can
then select some stories to fit the budget and focus on working in one
particular area until they deliver something visible and usable. </p>

<p>For situations where the stakeholders already created a huge backlog and there
are lots of potential impacts, it might be useful to first prioritise user
personae or customer segments, similar to the ideas described in the section
Focus milestones on a limited number of user segments. When the stakeholders
choose the next customer segment, they can select the next most important impact
on those users.</p>

<p>Putting five potential impacts in front of a group of business stakeholders and
asking them to choose the most important one is much easier than getting them to
look at fifty stories they cannot fully grasp. When the only thing on the table
is a bunch of small deliverables, the discussion tends to go towards striking
the right balance and giving everyone enough not to complain. When the choice is
between reduced fraud and increased payments, the current business situation
drives the discussion towards selecting one of them. This enables the team to
focus on achieving big business impacts with each release.</p>

<p>Because the number of potential impacts is often an order of magnitude smaller
than the count of potential stories, prioritising at a higher level is also much
faster. It is also significantly less volatile. If all key decision-makers agree
that fraud reduction is currently more important than faster payments, this
decision is easier to uphold when someone comes along with a seemingly great
product idea that would actually just disrupt delivery. When the plan is just
ten randomly selected stories, it is almost impossible to justify rejecting an
arbitrary change. When the priority is set on the level of business impacts,
unjustified pet features easily get postponed.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-44">How to make it work</h3>

<p>Ideally, select one impact to work on at a time. The question then becomes which
of the potential impacts the stakeholders want to achieve first. This will
simplify prioritisation: you just need to choose one instead of ranking the
list. It will also help you focus everyone on achieving the most important
impact quickly.</p>

<p>If you are capable of delivering iteratively (and we assume most people reading
this book are), there should be nothing preventing you from doing several small
deployments instead of one big release.</p>

<p>As a side note, if your stakeholders aren’t pushing you to achieve the most
important impact quickly, then it’s probably not that important to them, and you
should find something more critical to work on.</p>

<p>Make sure that the people who pick the most important impact are actually
empowered to make business decisions. Most likely, they will not be any kind of
proxy product owner, but the people actually running the business. Raising the
level of discussion to impacts will allow you to talk in concepts they
understand, so you should be able to get a sound decision. Apart from the fact
that choosing impacts pushes business decisions to people who should be making
them, getting stakeholders to prioritise impacts ensures that they all know what
is coming next. This will prevent unnecessary interruptions and random changes
to the plan, while still enabling the business stakeholders to change direction
if actual market opportunities change.</p>
