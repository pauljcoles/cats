<p>Story sizing is one of those universal causes of heated debates in online
forums, and a stumbling block for many inexperienced teams. Story sizing is
useful for one purpose: deciding whether a story is too big to implement or
small enough to get fast feedback. Almost any story sizing heuristic can help
teams make these decisions. But that’s it – story sizes aren’t really useful
for anything else.</p>

<p>Inexperienced teams often misuse story sizes for long-term planning and capacity
management, which is harmful and misleading. It’s quite common to see a huge
number of stories roughly estimated months before they will even come into
delivery, then all those numbers added up to predict when the larger piece of
work will finally be delivered. This often turns a rough first estimate into a
commitment to finish work on a particular date. The overall number and the
resulting date become an anchor for stakeholders and they are used to measure
long-term delivery. This commitment on scope and time leads to pressure to
follow a pre-determined plan and favours predictability over delivering value.
Because unexpected details are discovered only when stories finally come into
delivery, teams often end up being pressured to deliver software of insufficient
quality. Ultimately, such negative incentives prevent organisations from getting
the big benefit of agile delivery – being able to quickly change direction and
replan when market opportunities change.</p>

<p>Calculating a long-term estimate based on stories assumes that all planned
stories will be delivered and that nothing new will come up during delivery,
which completely defeats the purpose of adaptive planning. Even where someone
can correctly predict time-to-deliver for all stories, long-term estimates based
on stories are horribly misleading unless they are calculated using rigorous
statistical methods.</p>

<p>We’ve never seen a team carefully calculate margins of error or intervals of
confidence in their initial story sizes, let alone consider how adding,
multiplying and dividing those numbers might affect the overall interval of
confidence. Without serious statistical methods, resulting numbers for long-term
estimates are worse than pure guesses. The numbers look precise, so they provide
a false sense of accuracy and mislead people. The same applies to capacity
planning, for example using story points to calculate team velocity. It’s useful
to know how much work a team can do, but complex arithmetic on approximations
misleads and can open up opportunities for horrendous misuse.</p>

<p>When you are comparing stories, try to avoid using numerical sizes. Choose a
different sizing mechanism that allows you to make the distinction between ‘too
big’ and ‘just right’.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-key-benefits-41">Key benefits</h3>

<p>Numeric story sizes often result in tracking progress using the cumulative size
of delivered stories, which in effect measures busy work instead of business
value. There are much more effective ways of tracking progress and managing
short-term capacity and long-term plans than by adding up stories.
Unfortunately, numeric story sizes make it too easy for inexperienced teams to
fall into bad habits.</p>

<p>Avoiding numbers in story sizes prevents inexperienced managers from misusing
them. Not having numbers on stories also forces the team to look for more
effective approaches for long-term estimating and capacity planning.</p>

<p>Numeric sizing systems are often unnecessarily complex. We’ve seen teams waste a
lot of time arguing over whether Fibonacci numbers are better than powers of 2
or pointlessly try to differentiate between stories of size 7 and size 9. Using
a simpler sizing method helps teams to go through story planning quickly and
make the most important decision based on the size: should a story be broken
down further or not.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-41">How to make it work</h3>

<p>One good idea is to select several representative stories to serve as a
reference, and compare any new stories to them. Again, avoid numerical labels.
For example, group stories into small, big and unknown. Many teams use T-shirt
sizes, which is also a good approach as long as the number of choices is
limited. T-shirt sizing fails when people have to select among XXS, XS, S, M, X,
XX, XXX and so on. Limit it to two or three and you’ll be fine. The Goldilocks
approach also works – pull out stories that are ‘too big’ and ‘too small’, and
the rest will be ‘just right’.</p>

<p>For long-term planning, budgeting is a far superior approach than estimating,
but it might be a step too far for many teams. If you have to do estimates due
to political or organisational constraints, try to estimate based on average
time for a story to be implemented. This works pretty well with a small number
of preselected sizes. For example, review the past three months and average out
how long it took for a small story to be delivered. It’s likely that
similar-sized stories will on average take the same time to reach production.
Medium-term and long-term planning don’t really depend on accurate information
for a particular story, but for a group of stories. Averages over a period of
time tend to work well when applied to groups of similar stories, because small
differences cancel each other out.</p>

<p>Instead of using story points and velocity for capacity planning, try to manage
capacity based on analysis time or number of stories.</p>
