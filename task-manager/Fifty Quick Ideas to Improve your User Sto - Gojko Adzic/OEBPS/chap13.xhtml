<p>One good way of organising hierarchical backlogs is to use impact maps. An
impact map is a visualisation (mind map) of how deliverable scope connects to
business goals and the underlying assumptions on four levels. The first level of
the mind map is the business goal for a milestone of a project or a product
delivery. The second level of the mind map contains user segments, stakeholders
or actors who will be involved in achieving the goal. The third level of the map
shows the impacts on users and stakeholders that can contribute to the business
goal, or that could hinder achieving the objective. The fourth level of the map
is for the deliverables – user stories or even larger deliverables (such as
epics) that can cause the impacts.</p>

<p>Impact maps nicely organise the information held in the popular Connextra user
story card format (‘As a … in order to… I want…’). Visually, the second
level of an impact map corresponds to the persona or role of a user story. The
third level corresponds to the value statement, especially when teams use the
idea about focusing on behaviour changes. The fourth level corresponds to the
deliverable, or the scope statement. This makes impact maps a great tool for
grouping and discussing user stories, and moving away from linear plans into
hierarchical, adaptive backlogs.</p>

<p>Impact maps have three primary advantages over alternative techniques – they
are visual, collaborative, and simple. The simple four-level structure is easy
to explain and remember, so the group creating an impact map can focus on
sharing knowledge rather than the syntax of boxes or arrows needed to capture
information using some other techniques. Visualising the connection between
goals and deliverables helps stakeholders to align plans and priorities
speedily. One of our clients recently said that two afternoons of impact mapping
produced better alignment than weeks of typical planning. The simple format and
visual nature of impact maps invites collaboration and alignment, facilitating
the work of decision-makers to discover and set common goals for delivery.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-key-benefits-10">Key benefits</h3>

<p>Organising a group of stories as an impact map facilitates several levels of
decision-making and prioritisation discussions. A map has a single central node,
so the stakeholder group first has to pick one big business goal for a delivery.
This significantly helps with prioritisation and eliminating unnecessary scope,
which speeds up delivery.</p>

<p>Impact maps also facilitate many good product management techniques. For
example, because user stories are grouped under related impacts, impact maps
provide a way for stakeholders to pick and prioritise on a higher level, as
explained in the section Pick impacts instead of prioritising stories.</p>

<p>Because impact maps visually present the information held in the Connextra card
format, scope creep is trivially easy to spot. User stories that shouldn’t be
part of the current release cycle simply won’t fit visually into any branches of
the impact map.</p>

<p>Impact maps effectively visualise assumptions. When a deliverable is on the map,
a stakeholder has an assumption that it may achieve the desired impact on
customers. When an impact is on the map, a stakeholder has an assumption that
the change in customer behaviour will lead to the overall business objective.
This allows teams to design tests to validate or disprove assumptions,
supporting better product management. In addition, higher levels of an impact
map effectively become acceptance criteria for lower-level elements, helping to
reduce unnecessary work. For example, once an impact is achieved, the remaining
deliverables in that part of the hierarchy can be discarded from the plan, and
the team can move on to delivering the next most important impact.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-10">How to make it work</h3>

<p>When you are describing the goal of a milestone – the first level of the map –
focus on the problem to be solved, not the solution. Avoid design constraints as
much as possible. Creating an iPhone app is not a good goal, improving mobile
advertising revenue is.</p>

<p>When you are describing the actors – the second level – think about who can
impact the outcome, positively or negatively. There are often three types of
actors to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Primary actors whose needs are fulfilled (for example players with mobile
devices)</li>
  <li>Secondary actors who provide services facilitating the fulfilment of the needs
of primary actors (such as the fraud prevention team)</li>
  <li>Off-stage actors who have an interest but don’t directly benefit or provide
the service (for example regulators or senior decision-makers)</li>
</ul>

<p>To describe the impacts – the third level of the map – think about behaviour
changes you are trying to influence. Impacts are not product features. For
example better mobile search isn’t an impact, but a deliverable. Finding
information faster is a good behaviour change to describe instead. Thinking
about impacts in this way opens up many options for delivery.</p>

<p>When you get to the fourth level of the map, capture user stories, epics, tasks,
product ideas – all the deliverables that could potentially cause a positive
impact or prevent a negative one. Then treat them as options, not as
commitments.</p>
