<p>The MoSCoW model, splitting features into <em>Must have</em>, <em>Should have</em>, <em>Could
have</em> and <em>Would like</em> (really <em>Won’t do</em>), still seems to be the standard way
of prioritising work items. One of the biggest problems with this model, which
we constantly see working with clients, is that most of the items end up in the
<em>Must have</em> category. Lots of teams suffer from the <em>priority one paradox</em>: the
more stakeholders are pressed to identify highest priority items, the more
scared they are to leave anything out of that category.</p>

<p>The purpose alignment model, presented by Niel Nickolaisen in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321572882?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=swingwiki-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321572882"><em>Stand Back And
Deliver</em></a>,
is a good way to avoid that paradox. It is by far the most effective triaging
system we’ve used on software projects.</p>

<p>The model requires stakeholders to ask two questions for each item:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is it mission critical? (Can the business run without it?)</li>
  <li>Is it market differentiating? (Does it bring customers, provide competitive
advantage or something similar?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these questions have been answered, items can end up in one of four
categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<em>Differentiating</em>: both mission critical and market differentiating. This is
the area where organisations should focus most of their investment. For such
items, good just isn’t enough, excellence is required.</li>
  <li>
<em>Parity</em>: mission critical, but not market differentiating.  These are things
that have to be done, but they can just be good enough. Making them
significantly better than the competition is an over-investment.</li>
  <li>
<em>Partner</em>: market-differentiating opportunities that aren’t mission critical,
for example opening up an experimental sales channel using mobile devices.</li>
  <li>
<em>Who cares</em>: ideas that aren’t mission critical or market differentiating.</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose alignment model provides useful ideas on how to deal with each
category. The entire parity category is a great candidate for off-the-shelf
solutions, outsourcing, or just doing the simplest thing that could possibly
work. For stories in this category, seriously consider just integrating with
something existing instead of building your own software from scratch. Items in
the partner category often don’t have off-the-shelf solutions, but the
organisation doesn’t have internal expertise, so it makes sense to partner with
someone else who has that knowledge.</p>

<p>Categorising items according to purpose alignment helps organisations refocus
efforts. Without using a model such as this one, most of the work is often
devoted to creating complex versions of ‘must have’ items, even if they could in
reality just be good enough.</p>

<p>For example, an issue-tracking system for customer support is often mission
critical. Without a way to track issues, there would be no real customer
service, but for most organisations the issue-tracking component doesn’t deliver
a competitive edge. Yet far too often organisations build their own
issue-tracking system, and waste a huge amount of time and money on maintaining
those monstrosities. Unless customer call handling is really what sets the
business apart from the competition, it would be much better to change internal
processes so that they can work with an off-the-shelf solution or pay a third
party to customise an existing system to the just-good-enough level.</p>

<p>We facilitated several workshops where stakeholders decided to simplify their
business processes instead of complicating internal IT systems after realising
that most of their ‘must have’ items are actually just parity features.</p>

<p>A major advantage of the purpose alignment model over MoSCoW is that it has two
categories for ‘must’: differentiating and parity. They are both mission
critical, but the former creates value and the latter provides the necessary
foundation. It’s easy to separate out the items we must invest and excel in from
those that just have to be good enough.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-make-it-work-15">How to make it work</h3>

<p>The original purpose alignment model talks about business processes, not
software features. Since you are working with user stories, the value statement
(‘In order to…’) is most likely to help you do purpose alignment, not the
deliverable (‘I want…’). If you’ve inherited a large number of user stories,
or business stakeholders insist on detailing things into minute items, it’s best
first to group stories by business activity or area of impact, and then sort the
higher-level items into quadrants of the purpose alignment model.</p>

<p>If a story ends up in the parity or partner category, question whether it really
needs to be developed by your team, or if it would be better to integrate with
an existing solution or perhaps outsource it so you can focus on differentiating
items. If you decide you do have to implement a parity or partner story
yourself, make sure you discuss what would make it good enough. This is where
the QUPER model could well prove useful. Any stories in the parity category that
involve innovative solutions or complex changes need to be challenged
immediately.</p>

<p>Remember that items might move from one category to another as the business
opportunities change over time. For example, a mobile sales channel might be in
the partner category now, but if it takes off and becomes a major source of
revenue, then it could move to the differentiating category. In such cases, it’s
worth revisiting the assumptions and doing some more planning.</p>
