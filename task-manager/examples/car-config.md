Title: Paint Selection ‚Äì Finalized User-Focused Requirements

Description:
This ticket contains the finalized, user-centered requirements for implementing paint selection in the car configurator. These requirements are written in a clean Given/When/Then format, focusing on observable behavior and outcomes. They are designed to be testable, understandable by QA and stakeholders, and free from implementation-specific details.
The feature allows users to choose a paint color for their configured vehicle, see the change reflected visually, and understand any pricing impact. It also handles unavailable options gracefully and logs user selections for analytics.
