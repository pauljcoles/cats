# Automation Suitability Assessment Rules for TAF Framework - v2.0 (Behavioral Testing Focus)

## üéØ Core Assessment Principles

### **MANDATORY ASSESSMENT PROCESS**
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: No scenario conversion without completing all assessment gates
- **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**: Every decision must be documented with clear justification
- **GATE COMPLETION**: Each assessment step must be validated before proceeding
- **QUALITY ASSURANCE**: Rigorous evaluation prevents unsuitable automation attempts

### **BEHAVIORAL TESTING FOCUS**
- **TAF PURPOSE**: Test complete user journeys and behavioral workflows, not individual component behavior
- **UNIT TEST BOUNDARY**: Exclude scenarios better suited for React Testing Library/Jest
- **INTEGRATION FOCUS**: Include scenarios that test cross-component integration and business processes
- **END-TO-END VALIDATION**: Focus on user-observable behavioral outcomes

### **CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT STANDARDS**
- **NO BYPASSING**: Assessment gates cannot be skipped or abbreviated
- **COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION**: All classification decisions must include rationale
- **SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION**: Follow defined taxonomy and criteria exactly
- **FAILURE CONSEQUENCES**: Incomplete assessment results in immediate task failure

## üö® Assessment Gate System

### **üîí GATE 0: Architecture Layer Exclusion (MANDATORY - FIRST GATE)**

**Execute BEFORE all other gates**

#### **TAF Automation Scope Limitation**
TAF (Test Automation Framework) is designed for **behavioral UI automation only**. 

**AUTOMATIC EXCLUSIONS by Architecture Layer:**

##### **‚ùå EXCLUDE - Not Suitable for TAF**
- **NBA_DATA_SUPPLY**: Raw data changes ‚Üí Use unit/integration testing
- **JO_BACKEND_API**: API processing, scenarioTypes, JSON responses ‚Üí Use API testing tools (Postman, REST Assured, etc.)

##### **‚úÖ INCLUDE - Suitable for TAF** 
- **SPA_UI_BEHAVIOR**: Frontend behavioral workflows ‚Üí TAF UI automation
- **CROSS_LAYER**: Only if primary focus is SPA behavioral testing

#### **Behavioral vs Unit/Component Testing Boundaries**

##### **‚úÖ TAF BEHAVIORAL TESTING (Include):**
- **User Journey Flows**: Multi-step user interactions across pages/components
- **Cross-Component Integration**: How components work together in user workflows
- **Business Process Validation**: End-to-end business rule enforcement
- **Navigation Flows**: Page-to-page transitions with state persistence
- **Data Flow Integration**: User input ‚Üí API ‚Üí UI display cycles
- **Error Recovery Workflows**: Complete error handling and recovery journeys

##### **‚ùå UNIT/COMPONENT TESTING (Exclude from TAF):**
- **Individual Component Behavior**: Single component state changes
- **Component Props/State**: Internal component logic and rendering
- **Event Handler Logic**: Button clicks, form submissions (isolated)
- **Component Error States**: How individual components handle errors
- **Component Rendering**: How components display content

#### **Enforcement Rule**
```markdown
IF Primary Architecture Layer = JO_BACKEND_API 
THEN Automation Coverage = 0%
AND Recommendation = "Use dedicated API testing tools"
AND Skip Gates 1-6 (all scenarios excluded by architecture)

IF Scenario = Single Component Behavior
THEN Recommendation = "Use React Testing Library/Jest"
AND Exclude from TAF behavioral testing
```

#### **Gate 0 Documentation Template**
```markdown
Architecture Layer: [NBA_DATA_SUPPLY/JO_BACKEND_API/SPA_UI_BEHAVIOR/CROSS_LAYER]
Testing Type: [BEHAVIORAL_WORKFLOW/COMPONENT_UNIT/API_CONTRACT]
TAF Suitability: [SUITABLE/NOT_SUITABLE]
Rationale: [Architecture-based exclusion reason]
Alternative Approach: [Recommended testing approach]
```

### **üîí Gate 1: Behavioral Testing Classification (MANDATORY)**

#### **Behavioral Testing Decision Matrix**
For each scenario, answer these questions (ALL must be YES to include):

##### **1. Multi-Step Process Test?**
- Does this test a sequence of user actions across multiple interactions?
- ‚ùå Single button click ‚Üí Unit test
- ‚úÖ Login ‚Üí Navigate ‚Üí Select ‚Üí Purchase ‚Üí Behavioral test

##### **2. Cross-Component Integration Test?**
- Does this test how multiple components work together?
- ‚ùå Single popup display ‚Üí Component test  
- ‚úÖ Popup ‚Üí Navigation ‚Üí Page state ‚Üí Behavioral test

##### **3. Business Process Validation Test?**
- Does this validate a complete business workflow?
- ‚ùå Form field validation ‚Üí Unit test
- ‚úÖ Complete checkout process ‚Üí Behavioral test

##### **4. State Persistence Across Actions Test?**
- Does this test data/state maintained across multiple steps?
- ‚ùå Component state change ‚Üí Unit test
- ‚úÖ Shopping cart across pages ‚Üí Behavioral test

**RULE**: If ANY answer is NO, exclude from TAF behavioral testing.

#### **Primary Classification Taxonomy**
Every scenario must receive exactly ONE primary classification:

##### **‚úÖ AUTOMATION-SUITABLE CATEGORIES**
